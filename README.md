# A Facebook Bot demo R&D project where in person will type in a query and need to answer
  few standard questions.Collecting answers to that questions Facebook Messaging platform
  calls webhook providing the payload to our server which could then be used for further
  processing the entered data.
  The payload data is then extracted and then used to hit a third party API server that is
  fetching the possible conditions depending upon the answers provided by the user during
  dialog with the bot.
  During whole process facebook ensures request is being provided to the linked authorized
  webhook only.
